If a weights sequence is specified,- Completed 
selections are made according to the relative weights.- Completed 
Alternatively, if a cum_weights sequence is given, 
the selections are made according to the cumulative 
weights (perhaps computed using itertools.accumulate()). 
For example, the relative weights [10, 5, 30, 5] are equivalent 
to the cumulative weights [10, 15, 45, 50]. Internally, the relative 
weights are converted to cumulative weights before making selections,
 so supplying the cumulative weights saves work.
